# hello-world
GitHub Tutorial project

I'm just beginning my path into computer science, with a goal of becoming a full-stack developer.
Currently I'm working through a MIT OpenCourseWare on Python. My first real project was to create
a Hangman game, which I will add shortly. I am also working on a personal webpage that is pretty
basic.
